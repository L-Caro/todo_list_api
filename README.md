> Task Management System

Our task management system enables efficient planning, organizing, and managing of tasks within a team. It is specifically designed for a small business seeking a straightforward yet robust method for task management and team collaboration.

## Features
- **Task Creation**: Users can create new tasks with various details such as the title, description, due date, tags, and assigned user.
- **Task Assignment**: Tasks can be assigned to particular users.
- **Task Update**: Tasks can be updated as needed, e.g., to change the title, description, or assigned user.
- **Task Deletion**: Tasks can be deleted if no longer needed.
- **Task Comments**: Users can add comments to a task, enabling transparent collaboration and communication amongst the team.
- **Recurring Tasks**: Our system supports recurring tasks with various recurrence options such as daily, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, yearly, etc. This is very useful for tasks that need to be performed regularly.
- **Task Notifications**: Users will receive notifications when they get assigned a new task, when a comment is added to one of their tasks, or when one of their tasks gets deleted. This keeps users informed about important updates.

## Technology
The project is based on Node.JS and uses TypeScript for backend development. We interact with our MongoDB databases using Mongoose. Additionally, we use several packages, including:
- Express for our server framework
- dotenv for managing our environment variables
- JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure session management
- Google OAuth for authentication and login
- Moment.js for date formatting and manipulation
- Cron for managing recurring tasks

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a task management solution tailored to the needs of a small business. The system facilitates coordination and collaboration amongst team members, allowing them to stay organized, track assigned tasks, get real-time updates, and interact effectively. It offers transparency in task management and promotes accountability, thereby helping to enhance the team's productivity.
